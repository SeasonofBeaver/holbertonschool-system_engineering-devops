## For every additional element, why you are adding it
1. One Server
    Purpose: 
        To split the components (web server, application server, and database) across dedicated servers, ensuring each server handles a specific workload.
    Why Added: 
        Improves performance by isolating tasks and avoiding resource contention between components. Each server can be optimized for its specific role.

2. One Load Balancer (HAProxy) Configured as a Cluster
    Purpose: 
        To create a redundant load-balancing setup.
    Why Added: 
        Ensures high availability by clustering the new load balancer with the existing one. If one load balancer fails, the other can continue routing traffic seamlessly.

3. Split Components Across Servers
    Web Server (Nginx):
        Purpose: 
            Dedicated to serving static content and forwarding requests for dynamic content to the application server.
        Why Added: 
            Optimizes response times for static content and reduces load on other components.
    Application Server:
        Purpose: 
            Handles backend business logic and processes dynamic requests.
        Why Added: 
            Improves performance by isolating computational tasks from the web server and database.
    Database Server (MySQL):
        Purpose: 
            Manages all data storage and retrieval operations.
        Why Added: 
            Dedicated resources ensure efficient handling of database queries without interference from other services.
