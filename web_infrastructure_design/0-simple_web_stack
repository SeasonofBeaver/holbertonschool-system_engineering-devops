## What is a server?
A server is a computer which provides other computers/clients with services resources or data.

## What is the role of the domain name
It is a readable address of the domain so humans don't have to remember the IP address and can just remember the domain name.

## What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
typically it directly directs the user to the server with the corresponding IP address.

## What is the role of the web server
It is the entry point for http and https requests.
It sends back static html's back.

## What is the role of the application server
The application server is dynamic so it can validate user input and update the database in the backend.

## What is the role of the database
The database is there to structure and save data for the frontend to use.

## What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
The server uses http or https. Https is more secure so it is a better protocol to use.

## SPOF
SPOF or Single Point Of Failure means if the server the searched website is on goes down the whole website does go down.

## Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
During the downtime the website cannot be accessed. 
The downtime is there for updating the website and its configurations.

## Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
CPU, memory and bandwidth is the bottleneck so if too much traffic comes in it slows down the server response or can even cause the server to crash.
